00:00.000 --> 00:26.400
This is an extraordinary day for so many reasons, it is special because today we host the class

00:26.400 --> 00:46.000
of 2023.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.040
When I first came on campus, I haven't been here since I left back in 1976 and when you

00:51.040 --> 00:54.560
drive in it says, future home of something fearless.

00:54.560 --> 01:02.480
I love the sound of that guys, the future home of something fearless, that's us.

01:02.480 --> 01:13.040
What cannot be self-taught or learned in isolation is the ability to be changed, molded and inspired

01:13.040 --> 01:18.720
by the world around us.

01:18.720 --> 01:24.880
Be memorable, but be memorable for all the right reasons.

01:24.880 --> 01:30.880
We are tip and strong.

01:30.880 --> 01:36.880
Congratulations class of 2023, give yourself a round of applause.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.880
You did it.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.880
Congratulations to the classes of 2022 and 2023.

01:42.880 --> 01:57.040
Good luck and good tips.
