00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,400
This is an extraordinary day for so many reasons, it is special because today we host the class

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:46,000
of 2023.

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,040
When I first came on campus, I haven't been here since I left back in 1976 and when you

4
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,560
drive in it says, future home of something fearless.

5
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:02,480
I love the sound of that guys, the future home of something fearless, that's us.

6
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:13,040
What cannot be self-taught or learned in isolation is the ability to be changed, molded and inspired

7
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,720
by the world around us.

8
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,880
Be memorable, but be memorable for all the right reasons.

9
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,880
We are tip and strong.

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,880

11
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,880
