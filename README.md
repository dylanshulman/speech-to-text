Hello World! <br>
This video doesn't have too much speech, which is my bad, but it still tripped up Whisper. Anything with "Terrapin" or "Terps" wasn't correctly transcribed. "We are terrapin strong" turned to "We are tip and strong." "Good luck and go Terps!" turned to "Good luck and good tips!" Maybe these are issues that wouldn't appear with larger models of Whisper, but the small model didn't capture that inimitable Maryland pride. 
So I chose a different video file with lots of UMD-isms like "Testudo" and even "Terp-nappings" (kidnappings). Whisper got it right this time, even getting "terp-nappings."
